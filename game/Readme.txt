	The code does not work! I feel like I'm close with the with the missile from
the ship.  I can not get the Sprite to draw.  I really did not give myself enough 
time to figure the graphics out.  I have just been spinning my wheels.  I did 
however, ask some classmates for help, but I was looking at their code and it
looked simple.  At the time it seemed like I understood completely, but not even 
close.  I'll work on it some more before class and then turn in what I got.
